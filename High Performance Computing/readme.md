# High Performance Computing Resources

This directory serves as a hub for resources I have developed for using TACC's (Texas Advanced Computing Center) super computers 
to run computational expensive tasks. For instance, detector simulations in Geant4 can require an immense amount of computational power, 
especially when simulating complex geometries with many events.

# simulationSerialJob.py
This script is used as a means to generate 2 files needed to Geant4 simulations in parallel on TACC's Stampede2 (or any other for that matter) supercomputer. The first file is the launcher file which is a script that contains a line for each executable that you wish to run simultaneously. The second is the shell script submitted to start a job with TACC running all the launcher file commands simultaneously. 
- launcherExample is an example of a launcher file used to run 5 PET detector simulations in parallel. Notice each output file of the same type  has a different name per line so that our data files do not overwrite each other.
- serialJobExample.bash is an example of the bash script generated by simulationSerialJob.py to submit the 5 simulations runs in launch as a job on TACC with 20 tasks ran in parallel on 1 node.
