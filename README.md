# Firas Abouzahr's Collective Repository 
This is a collective repository and documentation/presentation hub spanning all of my research at the University of Texas in Dr. Karol Lang's high-energy physics research group. I actively conduct research over a variety of projects and collaborations:
* LEGEND-1000
* NuMI Beamline
* Positron Emission Tomography

Listed below are quick introductions to these experiments/project and my role in them. See the above directories to look at a small selection of my related codes and presentations. The selection is limted as many of my codes and presentation are for internal consumption (for now). For a more general overview of my and my group's research, see either of the two pdfs above, SPS_Presentation or Beyond the Standard Model.

# LEGEND-1000 
LEGEND-1000 (Large Enriched Germanium Experiment for Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay) is a proposed successor to the LEGEND-200, GERDA, and MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR experiments. LEGEND-1000's goal is to observe the theorized process of neutrinoless double beta decay, which would demonstrate the majorana-nature of neutrinos and consequentially the violation of lepton number conservation. LEGEND is expected to lead the world in a variety of experimental parameters that will give it an exceptional chance to find the Standard Model violating decay. One of these parameters is background supression, an extremely important characteristic for all neutrinoless double beta decay and dark matter experiments. One of the ways by which LEGEND-1000 will reject background noise is via the appartus known as the LAr Veto System. The LAr Veto system consists of a curtain of TPB-coated optical fibers surrounding the main germanium detector strings. The purpose of this system is to detect background radiation originating outside of the germainum detectors that is deposited within the surrounding liquid argon. Our group is currently working on a revised model of the LAr model that will consist of EJ-280 (a WLS material) plates rather than optic fibers. Geant4 simulations have shown that the plate model has improved photodetection efficiency compared to that of the fiber model and hence could have the potential to be a better background tagger. Besides for simulations, our group is striding forward with experimental verification as well. If experiment can replicate our simulations, we will propose this plate-based LAr Veto Systsem to our collaborators. As of now my role in our research has include: 

* Geant4 simulations to study the wavelength shifting, photon transport, and overall photodetection efficiency of EJ-280 plates, the current fiber model, and other related materials.
* Dark box experiments to characterize wavelength shifting materials, optic fibers, and photodetectors relevant to our R\&D of the plate-based veto system using various radiation sources and an electron gun. 

# NuMI Beamline
Our group has had an active role in various experiments at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) long before my tenure. One of our active involvements at Fermilab is with the NuMI (Neutrinos at the Main Injector) beamline, a neutrino beam used by the NoVA collaboration to study oscillations of muon neutrinos into electron neutrinos. While our group is actively conducting research for the NOvA experiment, we also have an important role in the beamline itself. Our group has designed, constructed, tested, and commissioned 2 types of beamline detectors used in the NuMI beamline: the hadron monitors and the muon monitors. The former detector, the hadron monitor, has been a large focus of my research since I first joined Dr. Lang's high-energy physics group. The hadron monitor is a helium-based ionization chamber used to detect the secondary hadron beam formed after the main proton beam collides into its graphite target. The collision produces a beam of pions and kaons (dependent on magnetic horn current) that eventually decay into muon neutrinos and muons. The main purpose of the hadron monitor is to detect these mesons before they decay as means of beam alignment and flux diagnostics. I acted as the lead student in the commission of the third generation hadron monitors and have recently begun to conduct analysis of beamline data from one of the hadron monitors that is currently active in the NuMI beam. My roles include:

* Construction and commissioning of the third generation of hadron monitors. This included working closely with our group's research engineer to connect all detector components such as the capacitor plates making up each ionization pixel, rad-hard cables for voltage input and signal read-out, and gas connections. 
* Electrical testing of all components to ensure proper connections, leak testing to ensure air-tightness, and source testsing with a 1000 mCi neutron/gamma AmBe source to ensure proper functionality before the detectors were sent to Fermilab. 
* Currently, I am now involved in analysis hadron monitor data from the NuMI beamline in conjunction with other beamline components (e.g., beam position and intensity data) in order to see if we can expand the usage of the hadron monitors for more diagnostics than just beam alignment. 

# Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
Besides high-energy physics, my group is also interested in the design and optimization of PET scanners used in variety of different medical settings. We conduct research both on the scale of pure group research as well as within an international collaboration, Time-of-Flight PET for Proton Therapy (TPPT). Within our group's research, we focus on the development of novel PET scanners and analysis techniques to improve scanner parameters (e.g., energy, timing, and Depth-of-Interaction resolutions) and hence imaging capabilities. We conduct this research via Geant4 simulations and experimental research using in-laboratory miniature PET scanners. The motivation beheind the TPPT is to use PET scanners for in vivo imaging of patients and beam range verification during proton cancer therapy. Our group has led the collaboration in designing, commissioning, and testing of the TPPT scanner. Personally, I have and still actively contribute to our PET research in a variety of ways (see below for a list of involments). I am also gearing up to act as the lead researcher in our group on Cherenkov radiation based PET using the scintillator BGO. My group currently has multiple papers, of which I am the one of the co-authors, that are near ready for publication over topics such as depth-of-interaction and proton beam therapy. 

* Design, development, comissioning, and characterization of novel PET scanners through Geant4 simulations and hands-on experimentation. 
* Design and development of other related PET scanner instrumentation such as cooling systems.
* Development of novel detection and analysis techniques to improve PET medical imaging.

# My research Interests:
* Detector R&D of all kinds: ranging from particle detectors to medical imaging instruments.
* Particle interactions with matter.
* Rare decays and exotic particles.
* Accelerator/beam physics and instrumentation.
